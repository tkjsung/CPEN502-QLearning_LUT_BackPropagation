## About This Repository

This is one out of the two repositories I have on this course. This repository contains code for reinforcement learning for the Robocode robot. The reinforcement learning algorithm, as per course assessment details, is done is two ways: Lookup Tables (LUT) and Q-Learning with Backpropagation.

The website on all things Robocode is available [here](https://robocode.sourceforge.io), with its GitHub repository available [here](https://github.com/robo-code/robocode).

Due to the development language of Robocode, I have written my code entirely in Java. .NET is an alternative programming language that will also work with Robocode.
